It offers an intuitive interface for managing contacts, tracking government contract opportunities, and logging communications. The application includes example data to help you understand the system quickly.

## Key Features

- **Contact Management**: Track individual, commercial, and government contacts with status indicators (hot/warm/cold)
- **Contract Opportunity Tracking**: Monitor government contract opportunities with deadlines and submission links
- **Follow-up System**: Flag contacts for follow-up with date tracking
- **Communication Logging**: Record all interactions with contacts (email, phone, meetings)
- **User Management**: Multi-user support with admin controls
- **API Integration**: RESTful API with JWT and API key authentication
- **Google Sign-In**: Optional Google identity provider login (see [Google Sign-In](#google-sign-in))
- **SAM.gov Integration**: Import contract opportunities from SAM.gov via the govbizops scraper
- **Gmail Integration**: Sync and send emails through the CRM per contact (see [Gmail Integration](#gmail-integration))

## Technologies

**Frontend:**
- React with TypeScript
- Vite build tool
- shadcn/ui component library
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- React Router for navigation

**Backend:**
- Python FastAPI framework
- PostgreSQL database with SQLAlchemy ORM
- JWT token authentication
- API key authentication for automation
- Pydantic for data validation

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) (recommended)
- Or for local development: Node.js 18+, Python 3.12+, and a PostgreSQL instance

### Deploy with Docker Compose (Recommended)

The easiest way to run the full stack is with Docker Compose. This starts PostgreSQL, the backend API, and the frontend in one command:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/pretorin-ai/simple-crm.git
cd simple-crm
docker compose up --build
```

Once the containers are healthy:
- **Frontend**: http://localhost:3000
- **Backend API**: http://localhost:8000
- **PostgreSQL**: `localhost:5432` (user: `crm`, password: `crm`, database: `crm`)

Press `Ctrl+C` to stop all services. Data is persisted in a Docker volume (`pgdata`).

#### Configuration

Environment variables can be overridden in a `.env` file at the project root or passed directly:

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `SECRET_KEY` | `change-me-in-production` | JWT signing key |
| `ENV` | `development` | Set to `production` to disable seed data and debug features |
| `LOG_LEVEL` | `info` | Logging level (`debug`, `info`, `warning`, `error`) |
| `VITE_API_BASE_URL` | `http://localhost:8000` | Backend URL used by the frontend at build time |
| `VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` | *(empty)* | Google OAuth2 client ID for the frontend Sign-In button |
| `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` | *(empty)* | Google OAuth2 client ID (backend - for token verification and Gmail) |
| `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` | *(empty)* | Google OAuth2 client secret |
| `GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI` | `http://localhost:8000/gmail/callback` | OAuth2 callback URL |
| `GOOGLE_PUBSUB_TOPIC` | *(empty)* | Pub/Sub topic for Gmail push notifications |

Example production deployment:

```sh
SECRET_KEY=your-secure-secret ENV=production docker compose up --build -d
```

#### Useful Docker Compose Commands

```sh
docker compose up --build -d   # Start in background (rebuild images)
docker compose logs -f         # Follow all service logs
docker compose logs -f backend # Follow backend logs only
docker compose down            # Stop and remove containers
docker compose down -v         # Stop and remove containers + database volume
```

### Local Development Setup (Alternative)

If you prefer to run services directly for development:

**1. Start PostgreSQL** (or use an existing instance):
```sh
docker compose up db -d
```

**2. Set up and run the backend:**
```sh
cd backend
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install .
cp .env.example .env      # Edit .env if your database connection differs
python run.py
```

**3. In a new terminal, set up and run the frontend:**
```sh
cd frontend
npm install
cp .env.local.example .env.local
npm run dev
```

The frontend dev server runs at **http://localhost:5173** and the backend API at **http://localhost:8000**.

### Default Login

The example database includes a demo user:
- **Email**: demo@pretorin.com
- **Password**: demo1234

**Important**: Change this password in production environments.

## API Integration

Simple CRM provides a RESTful API with two authentication methods:

### JWT Token Authentication

Full access to all API endpoints using JWT bearer tokens. Tokens are obtained through the `/auth/login` endpoint.

### API Key Authentication

Limited access designed for automation and integrations. API keys can only access:
- `GET /contracts` - View all contracts (read-only)
- `POST /contracts/import/samgov` - Import contracts from SAM.gov
- `GET /auth/me` - Get authenticated user information

To generate an API key:
1. Log in to the application
2. Navigate to the API settings page
3. Click "Generate API Key"
4. Store the key securely (it will only be shown once)

### API Documentation

Once the backend is running, interactive API documentation is available at:
- **Swagger UI**: http://localhost:8000/docs
- **ReDoc**: http://localhost:8000/redoc

## Development

### Frontend Commands

Run these from the `frontend/` directory:

- `npm run dev` - Start development server with hot reload
- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm run build:dev` - Build in development mode
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint
- `npm run preview` - Preview production build locally

### Backend Development

The backend runs with auto-reload enabled during development. Changes to Python files automatically restart the server.

To reset the database with fresh example data:
```sh
docker compose down -v         # Remove the database volume
docker compose up --build      # Recreate and re-seed
```

## Google Sign-In

Users can sign in with their Google account instead of (or in addition to) email/password. The "Sign in with Google" button on the login page is **only visible when `VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` is set** in the frontend environment.

### Setup

1. Create a Google Cloud project and OAuth2 web credentials (see [Gmail Integration](#gmail-integration) step 1 if you haven't already)
2. In the OAuth2 credential, add your frontend URL as an **Authorized JavaScript origin** (e.g., `http://localhost:5173`)
3. Set the **same Client ID** in both environments:

   **Backend** (`backend/.env`):
   ```env
   GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id.apps.googleusercontent.com
   ```

   **Frontend** (`frontend/.env.local`):
   ```env
   VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id.apps.googleusercontent.com
   ```

4. Restart both services

The Sign-In button will now appear on the login page. On first Google sign-in, a user account is created automatically. If an account with the same email already exists, the Google identity is linked to it.

> **Note:** If `VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` is not set, the login page shows only the email/password form. The backend `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` must also be set for token verification to work.

## Gmail Integration

Connect your Gmail account to sync emails with contacts and send emails directly from the CRM.

### Capabilities

- **Automatic email sync** - Emails are synced automatically via Google Pub/Sub push notifications. New emails in the INBOX are matched to contacts by email address and appear in the contact's Communications tab with subject, sender, direction (sent/received), and full body.
- **Send emails** - Compose and send emails to contacts through Gmail without leaving the CRM. Sent emails are automatically logged as communications.
- **Reply threading** - Reply to received emails with proper Gmail threading preserved.
- **Per-user** - Each CRM user connects their own Gmail account independently.

### Setup

#### 1. Create Google Cloud Credentials

1. Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Create a new project (or select an existing one)
3. Enable the **Gmail API** and **Cloud Pub/Sub API**: navigate to **APIs & Services > Library**, search for each, and click **Enable**
4. Configure the **OAuth consent screen**:
   - Navigate to **APIs & Services > OAuth consent screen**
   - Choose **External** user type (or **Internal** if using Google Workspace)
   - Fill in app name, support email, and developer contact
   - Add scopes: `gmail.readonly`, `gmail.send`, `userinfo.email`
   - Add your email(s) as test users (required while the app is in "Testing" status)
5. Create **OAuth 2.0 credentials**:
   - Navigate to **APIs & Services > Credentials**
   - Click **Create Credentials > OAuth client ID**
   - Application type: **Web application**
   - Add authorized redirect URI: `http://localhost:8000/gmail/callback`
   - Copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret**

#### 2. Configure Environment Variables

Add to your `backend/.env` (or your root `.env` for Docker Compose):

```env
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id.apps.googleusercontent.com
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secret
GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:8000/gmail/callback
GOOGLE_PUBSUB_TOPIC=projects/your-project/topics/gmail-push
```

To set up Pub/Sub for automatic sync:

1. Create a Pub/Sub topic (e.g., `gmail-push`) in Google Cloud Console
2. Create a push subscription pointing to `https://your-domain/gmail/webhook`
3. Grant `gmail-api-push@system.gserviceaccount.com` publish permission on the topic

#### 3. Connect Your Account

1. Log into the CRM
2. Go to **API & Integrations** (settings page)
3. Click **Connect Gmail** and authorize in the Google consent screen
4. You'll be redirected back with Gmail connected

#### 4. Usage

On any contact's detail page:

- Emails are synced automatically — new INBOX emails are pushed via Pub/Sub and matched to contacts
- **Email** button - compose a new email to the contact
- **Reply** link - reply to a received email (preserves Gmail threading)

### Production Notes

- Set `GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI` to your production URL (e.g., `https://api.yourapp.com/gmail/callback`)
- Add the production redirect URI to Google Cloud Console authorized redirect URIs
- The Pub/Sub push subscription must point to your public `https://your-domain/gmail/webhook` endpoint
- Gmail watches expire after 7 days; the system auto-renews watches when they are within 1 day of expiry
- Submit your OAuth consent screen for Google verification if serving more than test users
- Consider encrypting `access_token` and `refresh_token` columns at rest for additional security

## Security Notes

- API keys have limited access by design - they cannot modify or delete data beyond importing contracts
- JWT tokens provide full access and should be kept secure
- Change default passwords in production
- Use environment variables for sensitive configuration
- API keys should be rotated regularly
